This is  [home task 1](https://github.com/shri-msk-2017/rwd-home-task) for the Yandex Mobilization School

**Short description:**
This is web-site with gallery of cats and dogs. Which contatain these elements:
* Long Header (title)
* Description text
* Preview of image
* Ability to see full image in a modal window
* Special grid for the viewing of images 

Web-site is adaptive for all devices and screens. And also have images in special resolution for different devices (include Retina display).

For developing this project I didn't use technologies like Node.js, SCSS, any frameworks. Because I think it expensive in an educational task. It made with just HTML, CSS and JS.
